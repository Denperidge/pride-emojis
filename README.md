## Pride Emojis

A collection of emojis I have made for Discord in the style of Twimoji where they have similar counterparts. All src files are .xcf files as all of these have been made in GIMP.

## Origin

I started making pride emojis for a LGBT Gaming Discord server thats no longer around in June 2017. So do forgive some of the hearts in the Original folder, which includes an in-joke heart "Sandwich heart".
